event_sched.c is the solution to the assignment 1 problem.

test.c is capable of creating test case of size in millions and bigger.

check.c is capable of checking the correctness of code event_shed.c 
on the test cases.

a hint:
    ./test.out > case.txt
    ./event_sched.out < case.txt > output.txt
    ./check.out < output.txt

    assuming *.c compiled as *.out
